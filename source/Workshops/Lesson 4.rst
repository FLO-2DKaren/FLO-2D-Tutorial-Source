Lesson 4 – QGIS FLO-2D Plugin Buildings, Walls and Wall Failure
================================================================

Overview
________

Lesson 4 will outline the process of setting up buildings and walls and defining wall failure parameters in a FLO-2D
project using the Plugin for QGIS.  Apply these instructions after Lesson 1, 2 or 3 are completed.

This video shows the full process of this tutorial.

Step-by-Step Procedure
______________________

To setup a FLO-2D flood simulation use these steps.

1. Open Lesson 1, 2 or 3 completed project;

2. Assign buildings;

3. Assign walls;

4. Save and export;

5. Run the simulation.

Step 1: Open project QGIS and load the FLO-2D Plugin data
_________________________________________________________

Search the start menu and run the “QGIS Desktop” program.

QGIS Lesson 1, 2 or 3 can be used to for this project.
Click Open Project and navigate to Example Projects.
If QGIS Lesson 1, 2 or 3 are complete, choose any of these files to continue with Lesson 4.
This tutorial will continue from Lesson 3.

1. Click Yes in the FLO-2D window to Load the model.

Step 2: Assign buildings
________________________

.. note:: The video at the top of this tutorial shows how to remove, add or modify the building polygons.


1. Drag the Buildings.shp shapefile onto the map space.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh116.png


The Buildings.shp shapefile needs 3 Attributes.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh116a.png


These fields represent switches to set the calculation control for each building.

-  Collapse = 0 will ignore building collapse settings.
-  Collapse = 1 will apply the control for building collapse.
   If building collapse is needed, look in the Data Input manual for an extra data file.
-  ARF = 0 will ignore the ARF calculation.
-  ARF = 1 will calculate the ARF calculation.
-  WRF = 0 will ignore the spatially variable WRF but apply a T line to any totally blocked cell.
-  WRF = 1 will calculate the spatially variable WRF and apply a T line to any totally blocked cell.

2. Click the Evaluate Reduction Factors (ARF and WRF) icon.

3. Set up the parameters and click OK

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh118.png


4. Close OK the window.

5. The new layers show ARFs and Blocked Areas Polygons.

Step 3: Assign walls
____________________

.. note:: The video at the top of this tutorial shows how to add, delete, or modify wall polylines.


1. Clean the map.  Uncheck Buildings (user layer) and ARF/WRF (schema layer).  This will improve map loading speed.

2. Click Boundary Condition Points in the User Layer group.  Drag the file Walls.shp into the map space.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh120.png


3. If the walls are hard to see, make an adjustment to the symbology properties.  Double click Walls layer to open the
   properties window.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh120a.png


4. Click the Levee Elevation Tool from the FLO-2D Toolbar and click the Add Walls to User Levee Lines button.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh121.png


.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh122.png


5. Set the wall elevation and failure fields and click Add Walls to User Levee Lines.

6. Check Levee Failure

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh123.png


7. The levees were added to the user layer.
   Click OK.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh124.png


.. note:: If an error message was displayed, move the Walls Layer to the User Layer Group.


8. Click the Levee Elevation Tool from the FLO-2D Toolbar and click the Create Schematic Layers from User Levees button.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh125.png


9. In this case, only levee lines are used.
   Uncheck elevation polygons if it is checked.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh126.png


10. Duplicate levees were identified.
    Remove them by clicking Yes.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh127.png


11. Once the process is complete, the following image will appear.  Click OK to close it.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh128.png


12.  The FLO-2D walls are shown by the red cutoff marks.  Visually inspecting them can help QC the data.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh128a.png

13. Turn on levee failure by clicking the prescribed failure checkbox on the Levee Failure Widget.

Step 4: Export the project
__________________________

1. Click the Set Control Parameters icon and enter the data in the FLO-2D Toolbar.
   The following dialog will be displayed, make sure the Area Reduction Factors and Levees component switches are selected.

2. Click Save.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh129.png


3. This is a good point to save the project.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh083.png


4. Export the data files to the project folder in QGIS Lesson 4.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh163.png


5. Complete the export by saving the swmm.inp file and clicking through all the remaining messages.

Step 5: Run the simulation
__________________________

1. Click the Run FLO-2D Icon.

Summary
-------

This is the completion of a tutorial for adding buildings and walls to a model that is ready to run.
This tutorial can be applied to any project once the grid and elevation is assigned.
