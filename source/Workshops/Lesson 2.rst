Lesson 2 â€“ Channels
===================

Overview
________

Complete QGIS Lesson 1 before starting this lesson.
Use Lesson 2 to build an urban drainage channel and add culverts to the channel.

.. note:: This lesson uses an HEC-RAS import.  Alternate channel development methods are included in the advanced
          tutorials and coastal tutorials.  It is not necessary to have a RAS channel.

This video shows the full process of this tutorial.

Required Data
_____________

The lesson makes use of the original data from Lesson 1, left bank, right bank, and cross section data, and culvert rating tables.
Start from the end of Lesson 1.  All data is provided in the Lesson folders.  This lesson uses the same project and data from the
classic QGIS Lesson 2 but it does not use HEC-RAS data.  Instead, it uses the FLO-2D Plugin channel tools.

Step 5: Culverts
________________

This structure will calculate discharge through a box culvert.
This example has a box culvert that is longer than the grid element.
The channel segments are split up to allow for the width of the roadway.

.. note::  This image shows how the culverts should look once they have been digitized

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh074.png


1. Zoom to the first culvert.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh175.png


2. Collapse all FLO-2D Widgets.  Open the Structures Editor.
   Click the Add Structure icon.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh186.png


3. Digitize the first culvert

    - Left click the upstream left bank.
    - Left click the downstream left bank.
    - Right click to complete the line.
    - Click OK to complete the structure

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/addstructure.gif


4. Repeat the process on the second culvert downstream.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/addstructure2.gif


5. Click the Save Button on the Structure Editor.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh179.png


10. Click Schematize to write the data to the schematic layers.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh080.png


11. The hydraulic structures are now ready.

12. If the table and plot did not update, refresh the tables by selecting the structure again in the widget.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh081.png


Step 6: Interpolate the channel
_______________________________

1. To interpolate the channel segments, export the channel data and run the interpolator.
   In the Cross Sections Editor widget, click the Create CHAN.DAT, XSEC.DAT, and CHANBANK.DAT icon.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh084.png


2. Select the folder where the \*.DAT files will be saved.

C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\FLO-2D PRO Documentation\\Example Projects\\QGIS Tutorials\\QGIS Lesson 2\\Lesson 2 Export

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh085.png


.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh086.png


.. note:: If this process results in an Interpolate.exe error, it is possible to move that Interpolate.exe to another
          location.  Sometimes this file is locked by admin rights because it is in the Program Files (x86) directory.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh087.png


3. If the interpolation is performed correctly the following message will appear.  Click Import CHAN.DAT and XSEC.DAT to
   update the channel data in QGIS.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh088.png


4. Click the OK icon when the process is finished.

.. image:: ../img/Workshop/Worksh089.png


7. Export the project

Step 9: Final run and recovery point
____________________________________

1. Click the Run FLO-2D Icon.

5. If the run still has errors, repeat Step 8.  If the run starts, let it run.

6. Save and close QGIS.

7. Find QGIS Lesson 1 in a File Browser.
   Select the Lesson 1.gpkg and Lesson 1.qgz files and zip them.
   This will create a recovery file.

8. Name the zipped file.
   It is good to choose a name that identifies project progress.
   For Example: Lesson 2 Complete.zip.

9. Repeat this step after any time a Backup or Recovery Point is desired.

Summary
_______

This lesson was a simple channel import.  It used a Georeferenced HEC-RAS geometry file.
These files can be made with HEC-RAS version 5.xx, or HECGEORAS plugin for ArcGIS.


There are many ways to build channels with QGIS for FLO-2D and the other possibilities are outlined in the Advanced
Tutorials.  You can see these on the left hand table of contents.
