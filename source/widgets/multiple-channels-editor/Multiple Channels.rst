Multiple Channel Tables
=======================

|multip002|\ The Multiple Channel Tables layer stores data for user layers
and schematic layers.

The data is written to these tables in the following methods.

-  Importing from project;

-  Multiple Channel Layers;

-  Multiple Channel Widget.

External Layers
---------------

|multip003|\ This group of layers is data that was imported into the
project by the User. External data can be grouped and saved on the map
just like the standard data that is stored in the GeoPackage. External
Layers are not part of the GeoPackage. They are separate shapefiles,
tables and rasters that the User imports into the map.

*Note: External layers are not part of the GeoPackage so they must be kept with the Project Folder if the data is transferred to a different
computer.*
