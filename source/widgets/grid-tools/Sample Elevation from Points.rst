Sample Elevation Data from Points
=================================

1. Adjust the Style properties of the elevation data to assist the
   quality control measures for reviewing the data. For example,
   elevation data that has a large range can wash out the detail in
   local areas of the project area.

2. Double click the polygon layer to open the *Properties* window and
   select the style tab to perform the following.

3. Assign graduated colors;

4. Select field to represent colors;

5. Select color ramp;

6. Classify the data (classifying the data adjustments will assist in
   locating erroneous data).

   scale (see figure below).

9.  The sampling dialog box appears to select the point source,
    elevation field, and calculation type. Choose a max search distance
    to extend the search for empty grid elements. The distance is in the
    native map units. This field can be assigned a zero value to default
    to the minimum search distance.
