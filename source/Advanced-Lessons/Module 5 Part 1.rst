15. Click OK.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Module159.png

Step 9. Sample the rainfall raster
----------------------------------

1. Remove the original raster from the layers list.

2. Move the raster to the bottom of the map.

3. Use the ID tool to find the peak rainfall.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Module160.png

4. In this case, the lightest color is the highest rainfall.

5. 2.98 inches.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Module161.png

Step 10. Set up the rainfall
----------------------------

1. Collapse the FLO-2D widgets and click Rain Editor.

2. Enter the total rainfall.

3. Select or create a rainfall distribution.

   - C:\Users\Public\Documents\FLO-2D PRO Documentation\Rainfall Distributions

2. Click the Global Infiltration button and fill the form.

3. Click OK to close the form.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Module164.png

4. Click the Calculate SCS CN button

5. Fill the form and click OK to calculate and OK to close the message.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Module165.png

A scan of the Curve Number field indicates that the infiltration calculation was not correct.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Module166.png

Normally, the Curve Number calculator is used to calculate the SCS Curve Number for each cell.
The LandSoil shapefile that was provided for this project has good data but bad geometry.
It is so bad that the QGIS Fix Geometry tools cannot fix it.
This happens with complex shapefiles.
For example, there are hundreds of duplicated features.
The following ID click shows that there are 4 duplicate features in this specific spot.
Two alternate methods can be applied to calculate the infiltration.
Once either method is applied, the data is easily converted to the INFIL.DAT file.

1. Point sample the layer using the n value calculator.
   No averaging applied.

2. Convert the data to a raster and interpolate it.
   Weighted average applied.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Module167.png

Step 12. Alternate infiltration method 2
----------------------------------------

1. Convert the data to Raster.

2. Open the Processing Toolbox and search Rasterize.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Module168.png
