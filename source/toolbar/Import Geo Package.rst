Import a GeoPackage from a Previous Build
=========================================

When the FLO-2D Plugin is updated, the GeoPackage structure changes. The
project can no longer be opened in the standard method described in the
previous section.

To update a GeoPackage:
-----------------------

1. Set up a new project (see FLO-2D Plugin Settings). This will build
   the new Geo Database.

2. Select the Import from Geo Package icon from the FLO-2D Toolbar.

3. Navigate to the location of the Geo Package and click Open. This will
   import the old data into the new format.

   messages.
