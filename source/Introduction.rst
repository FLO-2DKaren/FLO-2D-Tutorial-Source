Introduction
=============

Welcome to Flo-2D's self help setup page. The purpose of the self-help kit is to get you on your feet with QGIS and the
FLO-2D plug-in. It'll bring you through the most basic features and tools of QGIS.
If you're interested in a more in depth tutorial of QGIS and FLO-2D, we offer
an Advanced Modules course.

On this page you will find all the resources and instructions needed, to successfully
set your computer up for FLO-2D's self-guided training. Below is a video with a step by step installation guide.
Its recommended that you follow along, to prevent any hiccups otherwise.
