Step 1: Prepare the map
_________________________

1. Use Quick Map Services to load an aerial image onto the map.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson005.png


.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan003.png


2. Make sure the Elevation Raster layer is checked on and if necessary change symbology to Hillshade.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan001.png

3. Simplify the layers list by collapsing unused groups and unchecking schematic layers.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan0013.png

.. important:: The aerial image and LiDAR map help define the left and right bank lines and help determine where cross
               sections are required.  Sometimes the LiDAR map is better and other times the Aerial is better.  Use
               both to help determine the best placement.


Step 2: Load the data
______________________________

.. Important:: The imported data is used as templates to move the class along and reduce errors.  These templates are not
               needed in general.  The channels can be built directly into the User Channel Layers.

1. Click the Channel group in the User Layers.

2. Drag the channel template shapefiles onto the map.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan002.png


Step 3: Left bank digitize
______________________________

.. important:: Normally to digitize a channel, you would select the Left Bank Lines layer and add a channel feature to it.
               That process is too slow and complex for this class. We will use a simplified method to reduce errors and time.
               The following animation shows the full process.  Open it in a new tab to study the method.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/makeleftbank.gif

1. Please proceed with a faster method to keep on schedule.

2. Click the Left Bank Template layer. It will be copied into the official layer.

3. Select the channel line using the select with rectangle button.  Drag a rectangle over the channel lines to select the line.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan0034.png

4. Ctrl-c to copy the line feature.

5. Click the official Left Bank Lines layer.

6. Click the Edit Pencil button and Ctrl-v to paste the line into the Left Bank Lines layer.

7. Save the Left Bank Lines layer and un-toggle the Editor Pencil.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan0037.png

8. Click the de-select all button to reset the select tool.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan0038.png

9. Watch the animated image for a demo.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/copyleftbank.gif


.. important:: Remember, this copy paste method is used to keep the class on schedule.  In your future projects, you can add a
               feature to the Left Bank layer instead of using the copy paste method.  The Advanced Channel Lesson on the left
               sidebar shows a more detailed explanation of channel development.


Step 4: Right bank digitize
______________________________

.. important:: Normally, you would build a right bank line just like a left bank line.  Again, that process will slow
               the class down too much.  It is demonstrated in the following animation but please follow the simpler
               steps below.
               Open it in a new tab to study the method.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/makerightbank.gif


1. Please proceed with a faster method to keep on schedule.

2. Click the Right Bank Template layer. It will be copied into the official layer.

3. Select the channel line using the Select button.  Drag a rectangle over the channel lines to select the line.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan0043.png


4. Ctrl-C to copy the line.

5. Click the official Right Bank Lines.

6. Click the Edit button and Ctrl-v to paste the line into the Right Bank Lines layer.

7. Save the Right Bank Lines layer and un-toggle the Editor Pencil.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan0047.png


8. Watch the animation to see the process.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/copyrightbank.gif


8. De-select all features and uncheck the left and right bank templates.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan003a.png


Step 5: Cross sections - fast method
________________________________________

.. Important:: Cross section editing takes time.  **Step 5 fast method** is used for this class.  **Step 5 digitize method**
               is to illustrate the process for your own projects.

1. Collapse the FLO-2D widgets.

2. Open the Cross Section Editor widget.

3. Click the Digitize Cross Sections button.

12. Watch the animation to see the process.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/copycrosssection.gif

Step 5: Cross sections - digitize method
________________________________________

.. important:: This is the method you would use to create cross sections on your own channel.  It has more
               details and instructions.  Review it but please use the fast method for the live class.

.. note:: Digitize the cross sections in order from upstream to downstream.

1. Zoom in on the southeast corner of the map.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan004.png


2. Un-check the Grid layer in the Schematized Layers Group.  If the Schematized group is un-checked, skip this.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan004a.png


3. Go to the Channels group and double click the Cross Sections Template layer.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan004b.png


4. Click Symbology and Click Simple Line.  Set the color to red and the stroke width to 1.  Click OK to close the
   window.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan005.png


5. Add the Snapping toolbar.  Right click the toolbar area and check the Snapping toolbar.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan008.png


6. Click the Config button and set it to Advanced Configuration.

7. Click the eye button and set the active layer to Cross Sections.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan0557.png


7. Collapse the FLO-2D widgets and click Cross Sections Editor.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan006.png


8. The first cross section has important restrictions.

   -  The line must cross the left bank line.

   -  The line must start in the same cell as the left bank line.

   -  The line must cross the right bank line.

   -  The line must start in the same cell as the right bank line.

9. Click the Add Cross Section Lines button on the Cross Section Editor.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan007.png


10. Digitize all 24 cross sections using process shown the following animation.  Use the red lines as guides.

    a. Left click the south side (left bank).

    b. Left click the north side (right bank).

    c. Right click to close the line.

    d. Click OK or use the Enter key to close attributes window.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/crossection1.gif


11. Handy digitizing tools:

    - Left click to drop a point.  Right click to close a polyline or polygon.

    - Rotate the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

    - Click and hold the scroll wheel to pan while in editing mode.

    - Use the delete key to delete the last vertex created.

    - Use the Esc key to cancel the polyline or polygon.

    - The point wonâ€™t drop until the mouse button is released.

    - Redo and undo have limited functionality and can be useful.  Ctrl-z to undo.

12. Once the last cross section is complete.  Click the Save icon on the Cross Sections Editor.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan009a.png


13. Remove the channel templates from the layers list.  Right click them and click Remove.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan010a.png

14. The final cross sections should look like something like this:

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan010.png


Step 6. Cross section attributes
__________________________________

1. The widget can be used to edit the attributes of the cross sections but that method is slow. Sometimes it is
   faster to use the attribute table editor.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan0061.png

2. Go to the User layers group.  Right click the Cross Sections layer and click Open Attribute Table.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan0062.png

3. Click the Edit pencil.

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Di5yDHg1fUk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

.. important:: The video discusses cross section development.  Methods to determine the urban channel geometry.

               a. As-built files are the first source of data but not available in all cases.

               b. Survey channel cross sections.

               c. Sample elevation data from a LiDAR raster. (This method only works if the channels are dry.)

               d. Measure and estimate channel geometry with QGIS tools.

1. From the Cross Section Editor, choose Cross-Section-1.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan011.png


2. Open the corresponding cross section text file.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan012.png


Data Location: \\Coastal 2D Training\\Project Data\\Channel\\Cross Section Station Elevation Files

5. Repeat this process for all 24 cross sections.

6. Use the mouse roller to scroll through each cross section to see that it has correct data.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan0076.png


Step 8: Schematize channel
______________________________

.. note:: If any of the following procedure needs to be repeated, always return to this Schematize step to reset
          the data before trying to modify anything.  It is a reset button and it is very important.

1. Click Schematize channel.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan015.png


2. If the channel schematizing process was successful, the following messages will appear.
   Click Yes and Close.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan016.png


3. If an error message appears.  Ask the instructor for help.

Step 9: Review bank alignment
______________________________

Channel alignment in urban projects can be important because channels are usually squeezed between features like
buildings, walls, and streets.  In this image, the right bank right along the houses.  Recheck the banks after adding
buildings.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan017.png


It is simple to make minor corrections to the left bank lines, right bank lines, and cross sections to realign
the channels.

1. In the User Layers group, turn on the Editor Pencil for Left Bank Lines, Right Bank Lines, and Cross Sections.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan018.png


2. Set the Vertex Tool to All Layers.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson033.png


3. Reposition the left or right bank so that it is better aligned with the right side of the channel.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan019.png


4. Click the Schematize button to adjust the Schematized Channel layers.  Click Yes and Close to close the windows.  In
   This case, hitting the enter button twice will be faster.

2. Nothing is required in this location because the channel terminates upstream of the boundary.  It will exchange water
   with the floodplain as the tide goes up and down.

3. The following image has is an overlay of the last cross section and the tide table.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan034.png


Step 12: Test Run
______________________________

The test run will help determine if the channel is set up correctly.  There are a handful of common errors with channel
modeling.

- Banks too close together.
- Last cross section needs to be lower than it's upstream neighbor to be an outfall.

These are reported in an the file **ERROR.CHK**.  If they exist, the model can't run.

1. Set the control Parameters and click save.  Turn on the channel switch and turn of the rainfall for this test.
