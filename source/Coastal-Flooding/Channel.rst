Step 5: Cross sections digitize
-------------------------------

**Important Note: Digitize the cross sections in order from upstream to downstream.**

1. Zoom in on the southeast corner of the map.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan004.png

2. Uncheck the Grid layer in the Schematized Layers Group.

3. Go to the Project Data group and double click the Cross Sections layer.

4. Click Symbology and Click Simple Line.  Set the color to red and the stroke width to 1.  Click OK to close the
   window.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan005.png

5. Add the Snapping toolbar.  Right click the toolbar area and check the Snapping toolbar.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan008.png

6. Click the eye tool and set the active layer to Cross Sections.  Set the snapping group to Advanced.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/snappingoptions.gif

7. Collapse the FLO-2D widgets and click Cross Sections Editor.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan006.png

8. The first cross section has important restrictions.

-  The line must cross the left bank line

-  The line must start in the same cell as the left bank line.

-  The line must cross the right bank line.

-  The line must start in the same cell as the right bank line.

9. Click the Add Cross Section Lines button on the Cross Section Editor.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan007.png

10. Digitize all 32 cross sections using process shown the following animation.  Use the red lines as guides.

   a. Left click the south side

   b. Left click the north side

   c. Right click to close

   d. Click OK to close attributes window

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/crossection1.gif

11. Handy digitizing features:

- Left click to drop a point.  Right click to close a polyline

- Rotate the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

- Click and hold the scroll wheel to pan while in editing mode.

- Use the delete key to delete the last point created.

- Use the Esc key to cancel the polyline.

- The point wonâ€™t drop until the mouse button is released.

- Redo and undo have limited functionality and can be useful.


12. Once the last cross section is complete.  Click the Save icon on the Cross Sections Editor.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan009.png

13. The final cross sections should look like something like this:

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan010.png

Step 6. Cross section attributes
--------------------------------

1. Go to the User layers group.  Right click the Cross Sections layer and click Open Attribute Table.

2. Click the Edit pencil.

3. Set the field to fcn.

4. Set the n value to 0.03.

5. Click Update All.

8. Click Save button and turn off editor.

9. Close the table.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chanattrib.gif

10. Methods to determine the channel geometry.

    a. As-built files are the first source of data but not available in all cases.

    b. Measure the width with QGIS measure tool.

    c. Measure depth from elevation or site visit.

    d. Measure side slope from elevation data or site visit.

Step 7: Sample elevation
------------------------

1. The rectangular and trapezoidal channels need bank elevation.
   Use the Cross Section Editor widget to sample the elevation from the elevation raster.

2. Set the Source to From Raster Layer: Elevation.

3. Click Sample bank elevation for all R, T, and V cross sections.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson024.png


4. Click Yes to finish the process.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson025.png


5. See that the Table and Plot now have full data for the R and T cross sections.  The N type cross sections have Place
   Holder Data.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Mod10_007.gif


6. Select the first Natural cross section and click the Sample current natural cross section elevation button.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson027.png


7. Repeat this step for each Natural Type cross section.

**Note: If natural cross sections are present, they can be sampled at the same time using the Sample All button.**

Step 8: Schematize channel
--------------------------

**Important Note: If any of the following procedure needs to be repeated, always return to this Schematize step to reset
the data before trying to modify anything.**

1. Click Schematize channels.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson028.png


2. If the channel schematizing process was successful, the following message will appear.
   Click Close.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson029.png


Step 9: Review bank alignment
-----------------------------

Channel alignment in urban projects can be important because channels are usually squeezed between features like
buildings, walls, and streets.  In this image, the left bank is on the wrong side of an urban wall.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson030.png


Urban channels also vary widely in their design.
This channel is not a rectangular channel or a trapezoidal channel.
It has a stepped gabion lining along the banks.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson031.png


It is simple to make minor corrections to the left bank lines and right bank lines to realign the channels.

1. In the User Layers group, turn on the Editor Pencil for Left Bank Lines, Right Bank Lines, and Cross Sections.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson032.png


2. Set the Vertex Tool to All Layers.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson033.png


3. Reposition the Left Bank Line so that it is in between the retaining wall and the channel.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson034.png


4. Click the Schematize button to reposition the Schematized Channel and click Yes and Close to close the windows.  In
   This case, hitting the enter button twice will be faster.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson035.png


.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson036.png


.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson037.png


5. If necessary, uncheck the Center button.
   This will keep the channel in place, so the corrections are easy to track.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson038.png


6. Squeezing the left bank like this means some of the bank elements might be inside the channel.

7. Slight corrections can be made to Left Bank Line to ensure good bank placement.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Mod10_008.gif


8. The same procedure can be used on the right bank.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Mod10_009.gif


9.  Always finish by clicking the schematize button to ensure the final edits were updated.

10. Once the final edits are complete, save and close the editors for the User Layers.

Step 10: Interpolate the channel
--------------------------------

**Natural Channel Geometry**

N type channels are interpolated using the Interpolator.exe program.
This method will outline how to call the interpolator and reload the data.

**Important Note: If this process needs to be repeated for any reason, click Schematize button before repeating anything beyond this step.**

1. Click the Create CHAN.DAT, XSEC.DAT, AND CHANBANK.DAT button.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson044.png

2. Select the folder where the \*.DAT files will be saved.

\\Coastal Training\\Project Data\\Channel Export

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson045.png

3. The first action saves the channel data.
   Click OK to close the message.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson046.png

4. The second action calls the Interpolate.exe program from the FLO-2D Pro folder.

**Important Note: If this process results in an Interpolate.exe error, it is possible to move that file to another location and make sure it is named
correctly.**

**Note: In this case only the 4 natural cross sections are used.**

5. Click Interpolate.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson047.png

6. If the interpolation is performed correctly the following message will appear.
   Click Import CHAN.DAT and XSEC.DAT to update the channel data in QGIS.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson048.png

7. Click the OK icon when the process is finished.
