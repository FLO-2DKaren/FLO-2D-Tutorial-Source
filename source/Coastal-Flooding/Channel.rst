.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan004.png


2. Uncheck the Grid layer in the Schematized Layers Group.

3. Go to the Project Data group and double click the Cross Sections layer.

4. Click Symbology and Click Simple Line.  Set the color to red and the stroke width to 1.  Click OK to close the
   window.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/snappingoptions.gif


7. Collapse the FLO-2D widgets and click Cross Sections Editor.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan006.png


8. The first cross section has important restrictions.

-  The line must cross the left bank line

-  The line must start in the same cell as the left bank line.

-  The line must cross the right bank line.

-  The line must start in the same cell as the right bank line.

9. Click the Add Cross Section Lines button on the Cross Section Editor.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan007.png


10. Digitize all 32 cross sections using process shown the following animation.  Use the red lines as guides.

    a. Left click the south side

    b. Left click the north side

    c. Right click to close

    d. Click OK or use the Enter key to close attributes window

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/crossection1.gif


11. Handy digitizing features:

- Left click to drop a point.  Right click to close a polyline

- Rotate the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

- Click and hold the scroll wheel to pan while in editing mode.

- Use the delete key to delete the last point created.

- Use the Esc key to cancel the polyline.

- The point wonâ€™t drop until the mouse button is released.

- Redo and undo have limited functionality and can be useful.


12. Once the last cross section is complete.  Click the Save icon on the Cross Sections Editor.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan009.png


13. The final cross sections should look like something like this:

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan010.png

5. Click Update All.

6. Click Save button and turn off editor.

7. Close the table.

8. Methods to determine the channel geometry.

    a. As-built files are the first source of data but not available in all cases.

    b. Measure the width with QGIS measure tool.

    c. Measure depth from elevation or site visit.

    d. Measure side slope from elevation data or site visit.

Step 7: Load cross section data
_________________________________

.. youtube:: Di5yDHg1fUk

1. From the Cross Section Editor, choose Cross-Section-1.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan011.png


2. Open the corresponding cross section text file.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan012.png


Data Location: \\Coastal Training\\Project Data\\Channel\\Cross Section Station Elevation Files

3. Copy the data and close the text file.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan013.png


4. Click the first cell of the of the FLO-2D Table Editor and click the Paste button.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan014.png


5. Repeat this process for all 32 cross sections.

Step 8: Schematize channel
______________________________

.. note:: If any of the following procedure needs to be repeated, always return to this Schematize step to reset
          the data before trying to modify anything.

1. Click Schematize channel.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan015.png


2. If the channel schematizing process was successful, the following messages will appear.
   Click Yes and Close.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan016.png


3. If an error message appears.  Ask the instructor for help.

Step 9: Review bank alignment
______________________________

Channel alignment in urban projects can be important because channels are usually squeezed between features like
buildings, walls, and streets.  In this image, the right bank right along the houses.  Recheck the banks after adding
buildings.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan017.png


It is simple to make minor corrections to the left bank lines, right bank lines, and cross sections to realign
the channels.

1. In the User Layers group, turn on the Editor Pencil for Left Bank Lines, Right Bank Lines, and Cross Sections.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan018.png


2. Set the Vertex Tool to All Layers.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson033.png


3. Reposition the left or right bank so that it is better aligned with the right side of the channel.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan019.png


4. Click the Schematize button to adjust the Schematized Channel layers.  Click Yes and Close to close the windows.  In
   This case, hitting the enter button twice will be faster.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson035.png


.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan020.png


5.  Always finish by clicking the schematize button to ensure the final edits were updated.

6. Once the final edits are complete, save and close the editors for the User Layers.

Step 10: Interpolate the channel
_________________________________
.. youtube:: 5CrrcZATtxk

N type channels are interpolated using the Interpolator.exe program.
This method will outline how to call the interpolator and reload the data.

.. note:: If this process needs to be repeated for any reason, click Schematize button before performing this
          step.

1. Click the Create CHAN.DAT, XSEC.DAT, AND CHANBANK.DAT button.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan021.png


2. Select the folder where the \*.DAT files will be saved.

Data Location: \\Coastal Training\\Project Data\\Channel Interpolate Test

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan022.png


3. The first action saves the channel data.
   Click OK to close the message.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan026.png


4. The second action calls the Interpolate.exe program from the FLO-2D Pro folder.  Click Interpolate.

.. image:: ../img/Coastal/chan023.png


5. If the interpolation is performed correctly the following message will appear.
   Click Import CHAN.DAT and XSEC.DAT to update the channel data in QGIS.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson048.png


6. Click the OK icon when the process is finished.

.. image:: ../img/Advanced-Workshop/Lesson049.png


Step 11: Channel boundary condition

Outlet
^^^^^^

1. Zoom to the end of the channel.

2. Nothing is required in this location because the channel terminates upstream of the boundary.  It will exchange water
   with the floodplain as the tide goes up and down.

3. The following image has is an overlay of the last cross section and the tide table.
