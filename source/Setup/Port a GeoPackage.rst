Port a GeoPackage
======================

As the FLO-2D Plugin is improved, the GeoPackage file structure changes.  If an older project is loaded into a new
geopackage, a warning will appear to alert the user that it needs to be updated.  This page gives instructions for
the current Porting method and the newer Porting method that will be released with the Plugin version 1.0.

As of January 2024, use the method for version 0.115.
