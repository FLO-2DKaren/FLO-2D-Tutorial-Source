.. important:: GDS and Mapper are old processor programs.  It may be challenging to install them on Modern Windows
               systems.  If any installation errors show up, try the **Ignore** option or see the Troubleshooting
               section.

1. Go to FLO-2D Pro Update >> Processor Programs >> GDS Mapper Installer and download the file GDS-Mapper-Setup.exe.

4. Street Errors??? Click OK or Enter key to close all of the Street error messages.
   FLO-2D seems OK with the streets but GDS
   doesn't like them.

5. Click the Select grid elements with a polygon button.

6. Click YES to create a grid layer.

7. Click 3 vertices to draw a simple polygon and double click to close.

2. Select the Run Do Not Save option.
